# Ultimate Guide to Cursor Agentic Coding: How to "Vibe" Code

Coding can transform from a tedious task into a seamless, enjoyable experience—what we’ll call "vibe" coding. With Cursor’s Agent mode, an AI-powered feature of the Cursor code editor, you can automate complex tasks, reduce manual debugging, and focus on the creative aspects of development. This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap to using Cursor’s Agent mode effectively, with practical steps, best practices, and tips to help you achieve a productive and enjoyable coding workflow.

## 1. Introduction

### What is Cursor?
Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to enhance developer productivity. It integrates advanced AI capabilities, such as intelligent code suggestions, natural language editing, and integrated debugging tools, to streamline the development process. Unlike traditional editors with AI extensions, Cursor embeds AI deeply into its operations, making it a powerful tool for modern developers.

### What is Agent Mode?
Introduced in the 0.43 update in November 2024, Cursor’s Agent mode is a game-changer for AI-assisted coding. It enables the AI to:
- Understand and navigate entire codebases.
- Edit multiple files simultaneously.
- Execute terminal commands (e.g., installing dependencies, initializing projects).
- Detect and fix errors autonomously.
- Generate code from natural language instructions.

This mode positions the AI as an active coding partner, reducing manual intervention and allowing developers to focus on high-level tasks.

### What is "Vibe" Coding?
"Vibe" coding is an informal term that likely refers to a coding experience that feels intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. By leveraging Cursor’s Agent mode, developers can automate repetitive tasks, minimize debugging frustrations, and create a workflow that aligns with their personal style. This guide will show you how to use Agent mode to achieve that seamless coding "vibe."

## 2. Getting Started with Cursor Agent Mode

### Installation and Setup
To begin using Cursor’s Agent mode:
- **Download Cursor**: Visit [cursor.com](http://cursor.com/) to download the application for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Create an Account**: Sign up for a free tier to get started.
- **Open Your Project**: Load your project folder in Cursor to provide the AI with full codebase context.

### Activating Agent Mode
To activate Agent mode:
- Press `CMD + L` (macOS) or `CTRL + L` (Windows) to open the AI pane, or click the AI icon in the sidebar.
- Navigate to the "Composer" tab in the AI pane.
- Select "Agent" mode from the toggle or dropdown in the Composer.

### Configuring Agent Mode
Customize Agent mode to suit your needs:
- **Rules for AI**: Set coding standards and preferences in Cursor Settings > Features > Chat & Composer. For example, specify that the AI should follow specific naming conventions or always write unit tests.
- **YOLO Mode**: Enable in Cursor Settings > Features > Chat & Composer > Enable YOLO mode. This allows the AI to run terminal commands and delete files autonomously, but use it cautiously to avoid unintended changes. An example YOLO mode prompt is:  
  > "Any kind of tests are always allowed like vitest, npm test, nr test, etc. Also, basic build commands like build, tsc, etc., creating files, and making directories (like touch, mkdir, etc.) are always okay."

## 3. Using Cursor Agent Mode Effectively

### Practical Applications
Agent mode excels in several scenarios:
- **Multi-File Code Generation**: Refactor code across multiple files, such as extracting React components or updating function signatures.
- **Project Setup**: Automate repository initialization, dependency installation, and configuration.
- **Debugging**: Analyze errors across the codebase and propose fixes, reducing manual debugging time.

### Advanced Techniques
Enhance your workflow with these advanced features:
- **Project Documentation**: Create a [README.md](http://readme.md/) file to provide context for the AI, improving its understanding of your project.
- **Notepads**: Use Cursor’s Notepads feature (Beta) for persistent context, accessible via the AI sidebar.
- **External Documentation**: Index external documentation via Cursor Settings > Features > Docs by adding a URL for indexing.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips for "Vibe" Coding

To achieve a seamless and enjoyable coding experience, follow these best practices and tips from experienced users:

### Enable YOLO Mode for Advanced Autonomy
- Go to Cursor Settings, scroll down, and enable YOLO mode for advanced code verification beyond linting.
- Example prompt:  
  > "Any kind of tests are always allowed like vitest, npm test, nr test, etc. Also, basic build commands like build, tsc, etc., creating files, and making directories (like touch, mkdir, etc.) are always okay."
- **Caution**: YOLO mode allows autonomous file deletions and terminal commands, so review changes carefully.

### Prompt for Complex Tasks
- For non-trivial tasks, use specific prompts to ensure correctness. Example:  
  > "Write tests first, then the code, then run the tests and update the code until tests pass."
- This approach ensures robust code and minimizes errors.

### Babysit and Iterate
- Monitor the AI’s progress and intervene if it deviates from your goals. Use prompts like:  
  > "Wait, wait, wait, you’re way off track here. Reset, recalibrate, get back on the right track."
- Iteration ensures the AI aligns with your vision.

### Build on Existing Tests
- Add more test cases and prompt the AI to update code until all tests pass. This improves code robustness and reliability.

### Visual Editing with Fusion
- Use [Fusion](https://www.builder.io/blog/introducing-fusion), a Cursor extension, for visual edits in your codebase. It leverages design system tokens for consistent styling.

### Fix Build Errors
- Use prompts like:  
  > "I’ve got some build errors. Run nr build to see the errors, then fix them, and then run build until build passes."
- Use "pre-PR" commands for fast checks (e.g., `tsc`, Prettier, ESLint).

### Debug with Logs
- Follow these steps:
  1. Prompt: "Please add logs to the code to get better visibility into what is going on so we can find the fix. I’ll run the code and feed you the logs results."
  2. Run the code and collect logs.
  3. Analyze logs with Cursor to propose fixes.

### Useful Shortcuts
- `Command K`: Make quick changes to selected code.
- `Command I`: Open agent chat with selected code context.
- `Command K` in terminal: Save keystrokes (e.g., "list my five most recent git branches").

### Additional Features
- **Autocomplete**: Press "tab again" for completions, though behavior may vary.
- **Bug Finder**: Access via `Command Shift P`, type "bug finder" to compare changes to the main branch for potential bugs.
- **Generate Commit Messages**: Use the source control tab and click the magic wand icon.

## 5. Advanced Customization: Building Your Own AI Coding Agent
For developers seeking a tailored experience, you can create a custom AI coding agent using Cursor and frameworks like Pocket Flow. This involves:
- **Understanding the Architecture**: Use a flow-based architecture with nodes for decision-making, file operations, and code analysis.
- **Setting Up**: Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Pocket/Tutorial-Cursor) and install dependencies.
- **Building and Running**: Implement nodes for decision-making and file operations, then run the agent with commands like `python main.py --query "List all Python files" --working-dir ./project`.
